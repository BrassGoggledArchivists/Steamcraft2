Universal Electricity or Buildcraft Merge?
==========================================

I was wondering...what if I were to merge this mod with a power system such as UE? I really wanted to
create my own power system, but I realized it would be an enormous hassle and would possibly conflict
with other mods (which is NOT acceptable). So, in order to make things simpler, I am considering using
either UE's power system or Buildcraft's. Your feedback is appreciated:
