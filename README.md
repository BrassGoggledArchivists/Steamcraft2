License:

This mod uses the MMPL v1.0. Please read it before doing anything else. Also, please don't just copy and paste massive chunks of code and claim it as your own! In the words of the CoFH team, "Don't be a jerk!"

Committing Changes:
===================
Anyone is welcome to make changes to this mod, but it must be said that we will not approve of 
every change if we deem that it does not fit the theme of the mod. Though the mod is open-source,
we still possess the power of discretion. Yes, there is an API, but its details are not fully
fleshed out/documented. Please give us some time before we make it suitable. Additionally, you must clone
the joint repository, not this one. The joint repo can be found here: <https://github.com/BrassGoggledCoders/SteamCraft2>
