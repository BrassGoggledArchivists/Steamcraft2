# Bugfix

Beta3:
++ Modular Armour

+ Flesh Golems! Still fairly work in progress, but placing two flesh blocks underneath a wire which is connected to a lightning rod (so, 2 x flesh, wire, rod, vertically) will spawn a flesh golem, which for now is just a weaker iron golem, when lightning hits the rod. Also, they are horrific o.0
