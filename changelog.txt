# Bugfix

Beta1: N/A
Beta2: N/A
Beta3:
++ Modular Armour
+ Clockwork Rocket Launcher
+ Nuclear Fired Boiler
+ Congealed Slime Block - solid block version of cobwebs. No idea why I made that :P
+ Chronometer of Time Manipulation - uses eyes of ender to swap between night & day
+ Spyglass - 3x Zoom, kinda neat overlay too.
+ Flesh Golems! Still fairly work in progress, but placing two flesh blocks underneath a wire which is connected to a lightning rod (so, 2 x flesh, wire, rod, vertically) will spawn a flesh golem, which for now is just a weaker iron golem, when lightning hits the rod. Also, they are horrific o.0
